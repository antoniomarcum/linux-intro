## Unix/Linux background

Unix is an operating system first developed in 1969 [1]. It was developed
as multi-user, multi-tasking system. There are many different forms versions of
Unix, most popular being Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X [3].

There are three parts for the Unix OS [3].

1. **Kernel** - Interface between hardware and applications running on computer.
2. **Shell** - Interface between user and kernel.
3. **Programs** - Sets of instructions that the computer performs.

Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. A process is a program that is
currently being executed, and is identified by a Process ID (PID). A file is
saved data.

Linux is a complex system, but understanding the basics and a set of most used
commands will be more than enough to get started on the systems.

## Useful concepts

Linux is case sensitive. The string "cats" is NOT the same as "CaTs".

Make sure to use the "control" key when necessary. This can be denoted as "^" or
<ctrl>. If a program requires the use of this key, then hold down ^ first, then
press the second key while still holding down ^.

Return (or Enter) key submits stdin to the system to interpret.

###Standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
stdint/out can be summed up as the input and output provided to a user. A user
providing commands are sent to stdin, and when/if there is a response, then that
is displayed to the user as stdout.
